## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work on mobile?</strong></summary>
Yes! The plugin works on both iOS and Android versions of Obsidian. Note that mobile operating systems may restrict background sync, so open the app to ensure sync completes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this alongside Obsidian Sync?</strong></summary>
It is <strong>not recommended</strong>. Using two sync solutions simultaneously can cause race conditions and data conflicts. Please choose one primary sync method.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I restore from a specific backup?</strong></summary>
Go to <strong>Settings → Recent Backups</strong>. Click the download button next to the desired timestamp. This downloads a ZIP file you can extract and manually restore files from.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I see LOCAL_ and REMOTE_ files?</strong></summary>
This indicates a sync conflict (the same file changed on two devices while offline). Review both files, manually merge the content into the original filename, and delete the <code>LOCAL_</code> and <code>REMOTE_</code> copies.
</details>
